"Weather Dashboard"

This is my weather dashboard. On the left hand side you will see a search bar, this is where you can search for the weather of your desired city.  Once the city is searched then it will populate in the "Current Weather" section of the page.

You are able to view the current City/Date/Temp/Wind/Humidity/UV Index of the city that you have searched. Also on the left hand side it will store all the cities that you have searched for.  You can then click on them and switch between cities. I added in a hover so that when you move the cursor over the desired city it will change its look.

Lastly at the bottom of the page there is a "5 Day Forecast" area and that will show you the weather of the current city for the next 5 days.
